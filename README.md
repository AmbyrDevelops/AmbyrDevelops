### ✨ About Me

👩‍💻 By day I'm a professional web developer for a research university. I love development work, exploring new technologies, and building things that allow me to flex my creativity and logic.  

🛠️ By night I work on projects using Docker, ASP.NET Core, Bash, Unity, and AI. 
I enjoy working with the ASP.NET Core web framework so much I'm looking forward to integrating this framework into [my portfolio website](https://ambyrdevelops.github.io).
