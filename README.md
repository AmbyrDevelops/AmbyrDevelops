### ✨ About Me

👩‍💻 By day, I'm a professional web developer for a research university. I love development work, exploring new technologies, and building things that let me flex my creativity and logic.

🛠️ By night, I work on projects using Docker, ASP.NET Core, Bash, Unity, and AI.  
I enjoy working with the ASP.NET Core web framework and look forward to integrating it into [my portfolio website](https://ambyrdevelops.github.io).
